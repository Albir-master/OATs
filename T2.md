**Task:** Consider ideas for connecting to your customer segments in an efficient and effective manner. First detail the channels through which you would contact your customer segments. How do you raise customer awareness? __**How can customers evaluate your offerings?**__ How do they purchase from you? __**How do you deliver value?**__ How do you provide support?

  Since our customers would be the businesses themselves, it would not be the best option to connect them through social media.The best idea would be a platform that is private, so only they would be able to connect us. We hope to be able to convince some of the smaller platforms at first and when we get the ball rolling, the larger companies will notice that we are doing a great thing with our service/product and will want to do business with us. This "word of mouth" will hopefully allow us to get our foot in the door with the larger companies and allow us to expand and grow. We will have several packages available on our website at different price points so they can see how much service they want along with the features that will meet their business needs. Our ace is going to be the 24/7 support we offer. Obviously being online, an attack can come at any point and we will be prepared to face them at any time of the day. Being able to respond quickly along with efficient tracking will put us ahead of the competition. Any data that we get will also be analyzed and will help us improve out product.

**Task:** Then describe how you would maintain customer relationships with your customer segments. What type of relationship do your customers expect from your organization? Can you use these relationships to acquire, retain, and up-sell customer segments? Consider direct personal assistance (either online or in person), self-service, automated services, user communities, etc.

  We would regularly contact the customers with any concerns. Since we would offer the service of maintaining the software for them we would regulaly be in contact with them. Still, because we would also have an intercommunication platform that would allow them to ask any questions and get answers within 30 minutes because security is on the line and we know that if a security breach isn't solved soon or any errors, it could lead into much bigger problems. We will be able to constantly monitor their systems and if there are patterns of an attack, we will try to get ahead of them and stop it before it happens. Also, when there are certain cybersecurity events going on the world, we can adjust to them and roll out a defense against those issues quikly and efficiently. We want our cusomers to feel protected and will offer both on-site service when implementing systems. Any large updates that will add new features that they need to know how to use, a person on-site will also be able to help them with any questions they have. Having a face-to-face option is always more comforting when learning something new. Any hotfixes and small updates can be implemented remotely online. We will have automated services that can collect data for our analytics which will be openly available to our customers as well.
