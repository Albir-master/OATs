**Background:** You are now part of a small and agile team of entrepreneurs who perceive of modern information and communications technologies as means of economic prosperity and community development.

**Mission:** Each team needs to design a viable online business opportunity and investigate its market feasibility. By the end of the semester you will have created a complete business plan to present to investors.

**Task:** Select team leader for current assignment.

**Task:** Select a specific customer segment (or related group of customer segments). Describe the customer segment(s) clearly, either demographically, economically, geographically, etc. What needs do these customers have? What problems do they need solved? Consider how these customers could benefit from an online business.

Our specific customer segment would be gaming platforms that store information as well as a place where transaction for video games and their codes would be. These companies are the heads of their industries and would have a lot of money to invest into any software that would be protect their users and products. Examples of these companies like Steam, EpicGames, etc. whom understand the important of data security. The customers which would be a businesses that have been hacked which has the threat of information stolen and specifically game being pirated. The issue that they face as all companies face now are problems with security. These companies compromise the realtionship with their customers and lose money when they not protected. Therfore they would have a need for this type of software. We know this is a reasonably idea as there are already developers trying to make softwares to fill this need. 

**Task:** Develop the value proposition you would want to offer the customer segment(s). Consider a wide range of possibilities such as online retail, non-profit, business-to-business, or government contracting. Consider products, services, information, and/or transaction support. (If you select a non-profit business, it must be able to sustain itself financially.) 

Our values are the protection of intellectual properties and prevention of piracy for different platforms as it is an ethical right to have your information safe and private. We would offer them the promise that our sotware would be able to be integrated into their sysystems and protect the applications they have.

**Task:** Describe your customer segment(s) clearly and in detail. Then provide a complete overview of the online business, including a clear description of the line of products and/or services. Given that the initial line of products or services is commonly a starting point rather than a full selection, indicate how the product or service goals are expected develop over the next five years. **Closely link your customer segment(s) needs and wants to the value propositions of your online business.**

Our bsuiness would be a software. At first we ould have to start development and testing it to make sure that it is consistent. After we are confident it we can start integrating it into the platforms on a small scale and search for any faults we come by. once we are sure of any preventable problems we fix them and moniter incase any more arrive. And update the software as needed. We would charger the customer a fee for implementing the program as a one time fee for buying the software. And as they are big businesses and would need help with maitaince we would offer them our services for a fee. Our main goal is to fufill our values which is protecting the games since they are someone else property and we woul succeed that by following through our plan and keep the platforms secured.

**Deliverable:** Project file(s) in GitHub repository containing above content.

**All members of the group need to contribute to the repository.**
