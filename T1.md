Consider how these customers could benefit from an online business.

Our specific customer segment would be gaming platforms that store information as well as a place where transaction for video games and their codes would be. Examples of these companies like Steam, EpicGames, etc. The customers which would be businesses that have been hacked which has the threat of information stolen and specifically game being pirated.
